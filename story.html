							<p>Hurty's History</p>
						</header>
						<p>Our story, like any other, started with a dream. We wanted to share the things we loved with the people we loved. Enjoying comfort food, being surrounded by friends, and feeling right at home are all staples at Hurty’s because that’s what matters the most to us. We hope every visit is full of good vibes and equally good conversations.</p>

						<p>After a couple years, Hurty’s grew to be a treasured spot among the community. Our promise of hurting your diet instead of your wallet is one we’ve taken seriously. Nothing beats saving your money and savoring fresh food at the same time. Specialties like the Hurty Burger keeps everyone coming back for more and even got Guy Fieri hooked. Hurty’s was proudly featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives! </p>
